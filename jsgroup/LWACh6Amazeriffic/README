Amazeriffic of Chap. 6

The code in Chap. 6 is for express v3, whereas we are using express v4, i.e.
the current express.

This directory has the express v4 code to replace code shown on pp 206-207.
Specifically:
client, Pg. 206: we can't use the "shorthand" $.post(...), because it has no way to
set the Content-type header on the POST request, and the server needs
to see Content-type:application/json on the incoming request to know how
to process it using middleware.  Instead the $.ajax full method is
used, which allows spec. of headers.

You might ask: why can't we just process the incoming data once received in the server?
But according to the API, req.body is empty until middleware parses the incoming
request and fills it in. So middleware is the appointed way to decode incoming
data. Here we need to convert incoming JSON to a Javascript object.

Express v4 has a built-in middleware express.json() to convert incoming JSON
(i.e. a request with Content-type:application/json) to a Javascript object.
So we need app.use(express.json());  instead of app.use(express.urlencoded());.

We would use app.use(express.urlencoded()); for processing form data, which
is "urlencoded".  We can have both of these working for us in the same program
since they do their work based on the Content-type of the incoming request.

server, pg. 207:
We need to use app.use(express.json());
