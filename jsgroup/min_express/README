min_express: simple express servers
server0.js: use express's built-in static server, on port 3000
for all files in current directory.
Works for Comments app fine, since it only needs an ordinary web server
to get its resources.

index.html, style.css, app.js: Comments app
To run: node server0.js
Browse to localhost:3000

server.js: use express to handle each request individually, and
handle "" as index.html.  Need to read file from filesys, either
with fs method or http's res.sendFile(path).

To run: node server.js
Browse to localhost:3000
